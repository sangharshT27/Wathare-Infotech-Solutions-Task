# Wathare Task

This repository contains the code for the programming task assigned by Wathare Infotech Solutions. The task involves building a web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to visualize and analyze data.

## Features

- Import raw sample data to a MongoDB database
- Plot data visualization on a horizontal time scale
- Render data points using different colors based on their values (green for 1, yellow for 0, and red for missing)
- Generate a summary table displaying the number of 1s, 0s, and continuous variations
- Filter data based on time range and frequency (hour, day, week, month)
- Integrate with a third-party API to fetch location and temperature data
- (Bonus) Sample data generation simulator

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- React Router (for client-side routing, if applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the dependencies for the backend:
4. Install the dependencies for the frontend:

5. Import the sample data to the MongoDB database (instructions to be provided).

### Running the Application
 Start the backend server:
 In a separate terminal window, start the frontend development server:
 The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
